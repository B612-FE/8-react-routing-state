# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# 8주차: react - routing, state


안녕하세요 프론트엔드 리드 **강나연**, **홍서현**입니다.

이번 주차 과제는 router를 사용해 여러 페이지를 연결해 보고, 전역 상태 관리 도구를 활용해 상태 관리를 해 봅니다.

보통 컴포넌트 간의 상태 이동은 prop을 내려 주는 방식으로 사용을 하는데요, 하나의 상태가 여러 컴포넌트와 공유되다 보면 특정 컴포넌트는 그 상태를 사용하지 않음에도 하위 컴포넌트로 상태를 전달하게 됩니다. 이를 props drilling이라고 하는데요, 이를 해결하기 위해 `recoil`, `zustand`, `context api` 등 전역 상태 관리 도구가 나왔습니다.

routing과 상태 관리에 대해 고민하며 과제를 수행하신다면 노력한 만큼 많은 것을 얻어가실 수 있을 것 같습니다!

## 과제

친구 목록 페이지를 만들어 봅니다.
